Like a tower defense but with units instead of towers.
Similar toth that other game you played a while ago where you had to buy troops.

You have one hero unit
You can buy upgrades for him if you want
You can also buy units and upgrades for those units.
The enemy will either be nothing and just send waves of units your way, or be a similar hero that does the same.

Build in co-op and vs modes.

You start buy buying some number of 2 or 3 base units.  These units can then gain XP and be upgraded into an entire tech tree.
When a unit levels up, you can allot stat points.  The stats it has determines what it can upgrade into.
Stats:
Strength -- Physical attacking strength.  Important to melee characters and crossbowmen.
Defense -- Reduces damage.
Aim -- Ranged attacking strength.  Important to all ranged characters.
Spd -- Affects attack speed and movement speed. (Don't make it matter too much)
Wis -- Affects buffs and mana regen
Int -- Affects magic damage and mana
Luck -- Affects lots of things in a small way.  (Crit chance, reduces damage, increases damage, etc)
